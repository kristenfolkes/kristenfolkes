# 👋 Hi, I'm Kristen

### Marketing, Partnerships & Ops | Building thoughtful systems that help teams work smarter

I’m a multidisciplinary operator with experience across marketing, partnerships, and program management — driven by a love for building structure, improving workflows, and creating seamless cross-functional collaboration. I’ve supported fast-moving teams across tech, creator economy, and global brands, helping them scale programs, strengthen internal alignment, and optimize the way work gets done.

Although I’m not a developer, I genuinely enjoy working alongside technical teams and supporting the systems, communication flows, and operational foundations that enable great products and partnerships to thrive.
